Narrative Essays is when the writer is narrating an incident or story
through the essay. So these are in the first person. The aim when writing
narrative essays is to involve the reader in them as if they were right there
when it was happening. So make them as vivid and real as possible. One way to
make this possible is to follow the principle of ‘show, don’t tell’. So you must
involve the reader in the story.

Descriptive Essays Here the writer will describe a place, an object, an event or
maybe even a memory. But it is not just plainly describing things. The writer
must paint a picture through his words. One clever way to do that is to evoke
the senses of the reader. Do not only rely on sight but also involve the other
senses of smell, touch, sound etc. A descriptive essay when done well will make
the reader feel the emotions the writer was feeling at the moment.

Expository Essays In such an essay a writer presents a balanced study of a
topic to write such an essay, the writer must have real and extensive
knowledge about the subject. There is no scope for the writer’s feelings or
emotions in an expository essay. It is completely based on facts, statistics,
examples etc. There are sub-types here like contrast essays, cause and effect
essays etc.

Persuasive Essays Here the purpose of the essay is to get the reader to your
side of the argument. A persuasive essay is not just a presentation of facts
but an attempt to convince the reader of the writer’s point of view. Both sides
of the argument have to presented in these essays. But the ultimate aim is to
persuade the readers that the writer’s argument carries more weight.
